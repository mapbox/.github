## Objectives

The governance framework aims to:

## Decision-Making

### Maintainers

Mapbox personnel are entrusted with the stewardship of Mapbox Open Source projects. Their role encompasses decision-making regarding the project's trajectory and overall direction.

## Conflict Resolution

Maintainers are the go-to for conflict resolution within the Mapbox Open Source community. In case of discord, they will collaborate with the concerned parties to iron out issues. Should a resolution remain elusive, the final verdict rests with the maintainers for the project or members of the Mapbox organization.

## Community Engagement

We extend a warm welcome to contributions from all quarters, individuals and organizations alike. Contributions could include code, documentation, bug reports, feature suggestions, or any other valuable input as deemed suitable by Mapbox Open Source project maintainers.
